# Disposable Email Domain List

In this repository you will find a collection of temporary email domains. You can import them into your newsletter software and filter from which addresses new subscribers subscribe.

The aim of the project is to allow newsletter owners to easily filter / block junk email addresses (like '10 minute mail').


## Files

In this repository, you will find two interesting files:

- [domains.txt](domains.txt) - list in TXT format
- [domains.json](domains.json) - list in TXT format
## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

Try to add new domains to `domains.txt` file in small chunks (up to 10 domains at once).

**Please always provide proof why such domain is 'spammy'!** (maybe some link to temp-mail service that offers this domain?)

Please don't sort domains in alphabetic order. Just put your update at the end of the list.
## FAQ

#### Can I add email forwarders to this list?

No. In this list I would like to keep only temporary email addresses, like this one that expires after 10 minutes or are one-time-use.

Forwarders (like anonaddy.com, icloud.com or relay.firefox.com) are just fine.

#### How to remove domain from the list?

Just send pull request with description, why domain should not be on the list
